'''This file extends base.py and includes settings specific to the development environment. It typically has:

    Debug mode enabled (DEBUG = True)
    Development database configurations (like SQLite for ease of use)
    Additional installed apps for development tools (e.g., Django Debug Toolbar)
    Any other settings that should only be active during development (like allowing all hosts for testing).'''
