    This file contains the common settings that apply to all environments (development, testing, production). Common configurations might include:
        Installed apps (Django apps included in the project)
        Middleware settings
        Template settings
        Database configurations (default or development settings)
        Static and media files settings
        Logging configuration
    By having a base file, you can avoid duplication of common settings across different environment files.
